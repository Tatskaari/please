            <p>Please has been built from the ground up with correct and reliable model for incremental builds, which
                can be relied on across languages and technologies. You worry about what to build, Please will worry
                about when to built it, no matter what languages or technologies your teams choose!</p>

            <p>Build steps are executed in their own tightly controlled hermetic environment. With only access to files
                and env variables that they have explicitly been given access to, builds have never been more correct!
                Please can optionally take this a step further. utilising Linux name-spacing to sandbox the network and
                filesystem!</p>

            <h2><span class="yellow">Powerful DSLs unify your build process.</span></h2>
            <p>There's more to a build system than just compiling code! Please provides a powerful framework for
                automating every part of your build process. Use the built in definitions to quickly get started, then
                expand on them, creating yourself a truly holistic build process. Generate terraform scripts, kubernetes
                manifests, or whatever you imagination conceives, while rest assured: the Please framework is ensuring
                correctness and performance no matter what you do.</p>

            <h2><span class="green">The developer experience you deserve.</span></h2>
            <p>Don't waste time learning a different tooling across your repo. No matter how clever you get, Please
                provides a uniform and seamless interface across your repo. Build any target and execute any test, all
                with the same CLI! Take this to the next level by using Please to download your toolchain for you: no
                more puppet or ansible. Define aliases for common tasks leveraging Please auto-completions for
                the ultimate developer experience. Written in Go, Please provides all this power behind a snappy user
                experience: no waiting for VMs or daemons to start up.

            <h2><span class="turquoise">Less incantation, more transparency.</span></h2>
            <p>Please isn't magic; it's built on a set of powerful core mechanisms that can be easily understood.
                By relying on these mechanisms rather than opaque abstractions, configuration is light weight,
                largely optional, and easily understood. There's no central workspace file that nobody truly owns with
                pages of configuration and incantation nobody truly understands.</p>

            <h2><span class="pink">Continuous integration & pre-merge testing.</span></h2>
            <p>We've developed Please in tandem with our internal integration tools, leveraging the build graph tooling
                to determine the minimal set of targets that need testing! Integrating with git, query changes between
                branches to to run on tests that have been affected. Export artifacts with a single command, leaving
                Please to figure out what needs to be built to do so.</p>
